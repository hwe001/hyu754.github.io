# Test a mix of finite element basis functions over a triangle
#
# Read a single triangle element containing 3 fields:
# * 2-D "coordinates" using a linear simplex basis
# * scalar "pressure" using a linear simplex basis
# * 2-D "velocity" using a quadratic simplex basis
# To complicate the problem, the linear bases use a scale factor set -
# even though all scale factors are 1, while the velocity uses no
# scale factors, so the default unit scale factor is used.
# It is recommended not to use scale factors for simplex and Lagrangian bases.
